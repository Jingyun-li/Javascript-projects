This is a simple photo viewer project that I wrote in JavaScript with its associating HTML and CSS files. As shown in the demo picture above. My photo viewer application can look at photos available in a folder that is created by the user locally within a specific range. My code made it possible for potential users to go both forward and backward when they are viewing photos. My implementation also made it possible to display photos chosen in the slide show, both in an ordered and a random manner.

The project illustrated my ability to utilize JavaScript to perform complex operations and, in the meanwhile, showcased my ability to use HTML and CSS to format a web page. All these athetic graphical designs were coded with a combination of HTML and CSS. The project shows my ability to make adjustments by interacting through these two languages.
